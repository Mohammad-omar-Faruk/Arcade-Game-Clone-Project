# Classic Aracade Game

In my Front End Udacity nanodegree, I had to code a classic arcade game based on the game Frogger. The point of the game is to get your character from the grass over the road and into the water. The challenge is to avoid the bugs that travel on the road. If a bug is touched, the character is reset back at the beginning. Upon reaching the water, the user is also reset back to the beginning.

## Installing from Source and how to play the Game

1. Clone the following repo: 
   * git clone https://github.com/Mohammad-omar-Faruk/Arcade-Game-Clone-Project
2. Load index.html in browser.

3. Play the game



## Instructions about How to Play:

* Use your arrow keys to move the player: up, down, left, right. 
* Ensure your player doesn't collide with the bugs. You loose a life and 50pts on any collison.
* Try to get to the water blocks at the top and gain 5 keys to win game.
* You have only 3 lives. Best of luck!
