## Instructions
* Use your arrow keys to move the player: up, down, left, right. 
* Ensure your player doesn't collide with the bugs. You loose a life and 50pts on any collison.
* Try to get to the water blocks at the top and gain 5 keys to win game.
* You have only 3 lives. Best of luck!

## How I built this
This game was built majorly using JavaScript object-oriented programming features.
